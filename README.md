# Sentiment analysis on social media data for disaster management and recovery

## Introduction - How can AI help in disaster management?

In case of any disaster, the first step is to formulate a critical response team to help those in distress. Before the team goes into action, it is important to analyze and assess the extent of damage and to ensure that the right aid goes first to those who need it the most. AI techniques such as image recognition and classification can be quite helpful in assessing the damage as they can analyze and observe images from the satellites. They can immediately and efficiently filter these images, which would have required months to be sorted manually. AI can identify objects and features such as damaged buildings, flooding, blocked roads from these images. They can also identify temporary settlements which may indicate that people are homeless, and so the first care could be directed towards them.  

Artificial intelligence and machine learning tools can also aggregate and crunch data from multiple resources such as crowd-sourced mapping materials or Google maps. Machine learning approaches then combine all this data together, remove unreliable data, and identify informative sources to generate heat maps. These heat maps can identify areas in need of urgent assistance and direct relief efforts to those areas. Heat maps are also helpful for government and other humanitarian agencies in deciding where to conduct aerial assessments.

## Proposal

Social media channels are a major source of news in present times. Some of the most actionable information, during a disaster, comes from social media users. Real-time images and comments from Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube can be analyzed and validated by AI to filter real information from fake ones. These vital stats can help on-the-ground aid workers to reach the point of crisis sooner and direct their efforts to the needy. This data can also help rescue workers in reducing the time needed to find victims. In addition, AI and predictive analytics software can analyze digital content from Twitter, Facebook, and Youtube to provide early warnings, ground-level location data, and real-time report verification. In fact, AI could also be used to view the unstructured data and background of pictures and videos posted to social channels and compare them to find missing people.

AI-powered chatbots can help residents affected by a calamity. The chatbot can interact with the victim, or other citizens in the vicinity via popular social media channels and ask them to upload information such as location, a photo, and some description. The AI can then validate and check this information from other sources and pass on the relevant details to the disaster relief committee. This type of information can assist them with assessing damage in real time and help prioritize response efforts.

So our team proposes make a system that will do sentiment analysis of social media data for disaster management and recovery.
